    "So far, you've learned about the formal rules approach to natural language processing. Another approach is to ignore the meaning of the words, and instead use machine learning to detect patterns. This can work in translation if you have lots of text (a corpus) or texts (corpora) in both the origin and target languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the case of Pride and Prejudice, a well-known English novel written by Jane Austen in 1813. If you consult the book in English and a human translation of the book in French, you could detect phrases in one that are idiomatically translated into the other. You'll do that in a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when an English phrase such as I have no money is translated literally to French, it might become Je n'ai pas de monnaie. \"Monnaie\" is a tricky french 'false cognate', as 'money' and 'monnaie' are not synonymous. A better translation that a human might make would be Je n'ai pas d'argent, because it better conveys the meaning that you have no money (rather than 'loose change' which is the meaning of 'monnaie')."
