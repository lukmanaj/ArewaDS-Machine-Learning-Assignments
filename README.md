# ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments

This repository contains the assignments given in the Arewa Data Science Machine Learning curriculum. The Machine Learning stage of the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship is a ten-week programme designed to develop pratical machine learning skills for the fellows. The original repo can be found [here](<https://github.com/arewadataScience/ML-4-Beginners-Arewa-Datascience>).

The breakdown of the concepts covered by week is as follows:

|Week|Content Covered|
|---|---|
|1|[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/blob/main/week_01_Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/week_01_summary.md)|
|2|[Working with data](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_02_Working_with_data)|
|3|[Data Visualization](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_03_Data_Visualization)|
|4|[Regression](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_04_Regression)|
|5|[Classification](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_05_Classification)|
|6|[Clustering](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_06_Clustering)|
|7|[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_07_Natural_Language_Processing)|
|8|[Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_08_Sentiment_Analysis)|
|9|[Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_09_Time_Series)|
|10|[Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/lukmanaj/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments/tree/main/week_10_Reinforcement_Learning)|

It will culminate in a real-world project based on a fellow's area of interest before proceeding to the deep learning stage.
