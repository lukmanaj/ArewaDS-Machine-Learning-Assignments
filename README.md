# ArewaDS-Machine-Learning-Assignments
The Machine Learning stage of the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship is a ten-week programme designed to develop pratical machine learning skills for the fellows. The repo can be found [here](<https://github.com/arewadataScience/ML-4-Beginners-Arewa-Datascience>).
The breakdown of the concepts covered by week is as follows:
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Working with data
3. Data Visualization
4. Regression
5. Classification
6. Clustering
7. Natural Language Processing
8. Sentiment Analysis
9. Time Series Forecasting
10. Reinforcement Learning

It will then culminate in a real-world project based on a fellow's area of interest before proceeding to the deep learning stage.
