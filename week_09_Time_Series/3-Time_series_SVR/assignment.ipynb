    "Now that you have built an SVR model, build a new one with fresh data (try one of [these datasets from Duke](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/ts_data_sets.html)). Annotate your work in a notebook, visualize the data and your model, and test its accuracy using appropriate plots and MAPE. Also try tweaking the different hyperparameters and also using different values for the timesteps."
