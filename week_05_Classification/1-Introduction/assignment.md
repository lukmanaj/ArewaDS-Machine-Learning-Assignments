# Explore classification methods assignment

Instructions

In Scikit-learn documentation you'll find a large list of ways to classify data. Do a little scavenger hunt in these docs: your goals is to look for classification methods and match a dataset in this curriculum, a question you can ask of it, and a technique of classification. Create a spreadsheet or table in a .doc file and explain how the dataset would work with the classification algorithm.

I did the assignment on a googlesheets in the link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUy7lFPMAXnxT-4GDWQte2pKtheGukxrJfs8shzc9Ds/edit?usp=sharing)
