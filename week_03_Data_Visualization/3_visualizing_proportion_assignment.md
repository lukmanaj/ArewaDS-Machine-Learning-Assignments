Here is the link to the Google sheet containing the assignment.[Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P9WzDwSaS9X0_b-lWrm41_FQy0Oeri-VPM8ugaLjkJY/edit?usp=sharing).

The spreadsheet contains both pie and donut charts. Waffle charts are not supported by my version of sheets. Turns out waffle charts do not come with regular chart packages.
