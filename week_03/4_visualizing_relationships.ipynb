    "Continuing with the nature focus of our research, let's discover interesting visualizations to show the relationships between various types of honey, according to a dataset derived from the United States Department of Agriculture.\n",

    "This dataset of about 600 items displays honey production in many U.S. states. So, for example, you can look at the number of colonies, yield per colony, total production, stocks, price per pound, and value of the honey produced in a given state from 1998-2012, with one row per year for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be interesting to visualize the relationship between a given state's production per year and, for example, the price of honey in that state. Alternately, you could visualize the relationship between states' honey yield per colony. This year span covers the devastating 'CCD' or 'Colony Collapse Disorder' first seen in 2006 (http://npic.orst.edu/envir/ccd.html), so it is a poignant dataset to study. üêù"
